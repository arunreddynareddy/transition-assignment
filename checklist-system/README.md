# A Simple Checklist System Using Node.js

You need to create a Checklist System in Node.js that evaluates certain conditions
based on the provided input data (fetched from an API) and displays a dashboard with
results showing which conditions have passed and failed.

####  Future Proofing:
To add or modify a rule in the future:

Simply update the checklistRules array in config.js.
Each rule is a standalone object with a name and a condition function. Adding new rules is as simple as adding a new object to the array.
